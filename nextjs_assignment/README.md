# Plutus Developer Audition

This is a repository containing a template for a Plutus Developer Audition. We don't believe in DSA interviews—what matters is your ability to write real-world code. This project is designed to be a test of that. It should not take you more than a couple of hours to implement everything. (**Using AI code helpers is allowed**, as long as you check the code and don't copy-paste blindly.) We are a fast-paced team, and this project mimics the real-world coding that you might be doing on a day-to-day basis. This project can also help you develop your CV, even if you don't end up working with us.

## How it works

The hiring process for us is simple:
- You fork this repository and develop a Next.js solution.
- We hop on a call and discuss your solution—why you used a certain approach, potential alternatives, etc.
- We review internally and provide feedback on your solution.

## Prerequisites

You need to know the following tools and languages to work with this:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Problem statement

Refer the Notion Page provided along with this boilerplate.

## Getting Started with the Project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Steps After Completion
After you're done with the implementation, you should:

 - Fill in the following form to let us know about your project: https://forms.gle/Y7wWEvKmjecjyBDb9
 - We will set up a 30-minute/1-hour call to discuss the project in detail.
 - We will make a decision.

## Deadline
We understand that you might have some commitments and might be short on time. We want to treat this exercise as a replacement for a DSA interview. With that said, the deadline for project submission is **3 days from the date you receive the email for this assignment** or one **day from the time you fork this repo**.
